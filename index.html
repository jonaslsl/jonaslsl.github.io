  <p>I have been working with web since 2009 as a web developer. I really enjoy searching for new solutions, standards and technologies that can improve productivity and change the way that we deal with our daily tasks and projects. It basically means that I am committed and a passionate self learner.</p>
  <p>Currently I am working with Angular.js and Ruby on Rails projects and I am 2 years teacher of responsive web design development and teacher of HTML5 and CSS3.<p>
  <p>In addition of my strong knowledge of Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 I also work with:
PHP, Wordpress, Phonegap, JQuery, Coffee Script, Sencha, Unix, Git, MVC, Facebook and Google APIs, Boostrap/Foundation, SEO, Shopify, BDD (Jasmine), Vagrant, Gulp/Grunt, Scrum, LESS and SASS.</p>
